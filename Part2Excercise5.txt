To add a BoxBug actor to the grid:
1) Create a new BoxBug object, with the desired value for sideLength as parameter

	BoxBug billyHill = new BoxBug(5); 

2) Add the new BoxBug to the world. Its location can either be random (by only having the parameter of the bug's name), or specific (by including a parameter for the position of the bug on the grid).

	world.add(willyWolly); 

	 
	world.add(new Location(1,1), pillDre);

3)If the color of the bug is desired to be set, call the setColor(Color.NameofColor) method from the BoxBug whose color is wished to change.

	MrBug.setColor(Color.Blue);
